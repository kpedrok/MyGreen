# MyGreen - NASA Space Apps Challange 2019

# PROBLEM
- 4.2 million of peoples die every year due to ambient air pollution
- 3.8 million of peoples die every year due to household air pollution
- The number of early deaths caused by air pollution is double previous estimates, according to research, meaning toxic air is killing more people than tobacco smoking.
- Lack of information about air quality and ambiental problems leads to a lifestyle that is harming our world.

# SOLUTION
MyGreen is an app that's uses gamification to engage people and raise awareness about Sustainable Development Goals. Besides improving the lifestyle of the users.

- Help process and identify elements that require human eye for classification.
- Help train a deep neural network for future automation.

# Value proposition:
Users will enjoy of an engaging and easy to use game that:

Will help them contribute to the science community.
Will help them learn more about deep space exploration.
Will make them have fun!
providing countries a management tool to implement development strategies and to monitor and achieve progress.
Earth observation solutions to address SDG interlinkages and trade-offs, e.g., linking land use/land cover change or management to freshwater and coastal pollution, and addressing multiple SDG targets through one solution.
Solutions to identify, monitor, and address or improve environmental factors affecting human health.
Solutions to map and analyze urban population patterns including the proportion of urban population living in informal settlements or inadequate housing.
Visualizations or interactive applications to showcase the interconnectedness of SDGs in people’s lives via the use of NASA Earth observation data as well as information generated by crowd-sourcing, social media, and in situ measurements.
decision support tool that helps monitor disease patterns, identify environmental factors that contribute to the spread of diseases, such as vector-borne diseases, and specify areas requiring disease-control planning.
A user-friendly product that integrates national and global level data including in situ observations from regular monitoring stations for coastal eutrophication/pollution.
An interactive application and/or data visualization tool that tracks and visualizes how marine litter/garbage circulates (and is transported) around the world – its origins and/or factors that influence its movement (e.g. ocean currents, other).
An analysis and visualization tool that demonstrates how Earth observations can help assess SDG interlinkages and tradeoffs, especially as they relate to the sustainable use of natural resources.

# MAIN FEATURES OF MYGREEN
Identify, monitor, and address environmental factors affecting human health.
Map and analyze urban population patterns

## How do we maintain customer engagement?
Gamification will be one the biggest engagement tool used for the app.
The game will focus on short 5-10 minute missions to allow the gameplay while commuting or waiting at the dentist!
The more time you win the higher is your grade and your city grade.
The designed scoring system will not only engage users, but also ensure that the collected data is accurate.
Grow the community and enable users to engage and discuss classification experiences.
